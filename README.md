Drum-kit webpage. 

Reason: This is from an assignment in the programme (that I participated in): 
"The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp", given by App Brewery, Angela Yu (via Udemy.com).

Motivation: Learn more html, css and javascript, without involving libraries or frameworks. 

Drum-kit: few drums and sounds, activated by click or typing certain keyboards.
